            Zuma Rock is a large natural monolith, an igneous intrusion composed of gabbro and granodiorite, in Niger State, Nigeria. It is located immediately west of Nigeria's capital Abuja, along the main road from Abuja to Kaduna off Madala, and is sometimes referred to as the "Gateway to Abuja from Suleja". Zuma Rock rises approx. 300 metres above its surroundings. Zuma Rock is depicted on the 100 naira note. It was used for a defensive retreat by the Gbagyi people against invading neighbouring tribes during intertribal warring.
