            Northeast Greenland National Park is the world's largest national park and the 9th largest protected area. Established in 1974 and expanded to its present size in 1988, it protects 972,000 kmÂ² of the interior and northeastern coast of Greenland and is bigger than all but 29 of the world's 195 countries. It was the first national park to be created in the Kingdom of Denmark and remains Greenland's only national park. It is the northernmost national park in the world. It is the second largest by area of any second level subdivision of any country in the world trailing only the Qikiqtaaluk Region, Nunavut, Canada.
