            The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across 
            the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as 
            protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls 
            were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective stretches later joined 
            together by Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. 
            Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. 
            The most well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty. Apart from defense, 
            other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties 
            on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of 
            immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced 
            by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the 
            means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor. 
            The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses.
