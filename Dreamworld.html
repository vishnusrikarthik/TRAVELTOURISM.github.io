            Dreamworld is a theme park and zoo situated on the Gold Coast in Queensland. It is Australia's biggest theme park with over 40 rides and attractions. The park is made up of several themed lands: Ocean Parade, DreamWorks Experience, ABC Kids World, Tiger Island, Main Street, Gold Rush Country, Whitewater World and Corroboree. These lands have a collection of rides, animal exhibits, shows, food outlets and merchandise shops. Dreamworld is currently home to four roller coasters. The oldest is The Gold Coaster and the newest is BuzzSaw. In 2019, Dreamworld announced a new roller coaster built by Mack Rides, named Steel Taipan. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the opening of the coaster has been moved to late 2021. Dreamworld was known for being the former location of the Australian Big Brother house filmed at the Dreamworld Studios, since the program began in Australia from 2001 to 2014. In December 2006, Dreamworld expanded its offerings by opening WhiteWater World next door. On several occasions during the year, Dreamworld remains open after dark. This event, known as Park After Dark, includes all of the thrill rides and a children's rides.
