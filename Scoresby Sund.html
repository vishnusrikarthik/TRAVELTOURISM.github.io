            Scoresby Sound is a large fjord system of the Greenland Sea on the eastern coast of Greenland. It has a tree-like structure, with a main body approximately 110 km long that branches into a system of fjords covering an area of about 38,000 km². The longest of the fjords extends 340–350 km inland from the coastline. The depth is 400–600 m in the main basin, but depths increase to up to 1,450 m in some fjords. It is one of the largest and longest fjord systems in the world. On the northern side of the mouth of the Scoresby Sound stands Ittoqqortoormiit, the only permanent settlement in the region, with a population of 469. The name of the sound honours English explorer William Scoresby, who in 1822 mapped the fjord area in detail.
