            Tokyo Disneyland is a 115-acre theme park at the Tokyo Disney Resort in Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture, Japan, near Tokyo.
             Its main gate is directly adjacent to both Maihama Station and Tokyo Disneyland Station. It was the first Disney park 
             to be built outside the United States and it opened on April 15, 1983. The park was constructed by WED Enterprises in the 
             same style as Magic Kingdom in Florida and Disneyland in California. It is owned by The Oriental Land Company, which licenses 
             the theme from The Walt Disney Company. Tokyo Disneyland and its companion park, Tokyo DisneySea, are the only Disney parks not 
             wholly or partly owned by the Walt Disney Company. The park has seven themed areas: the World Bazaar; the four traditional Disney 
             lands: Adventureland, Westernland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland; and two mini-lands: Critter Country and Toontown. Many of these 
             areas mirror those in the original Disneyland as they are based on American Disney films and fantasies. 
             Fantasyland includes Peter Pan's Flight, Snow White's Scary Adventures, and Dumbo the Flying Elephant, based on Disney films and characters.
