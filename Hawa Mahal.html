        <p>Hawa Mahal is a palace in Jaipur, India approximately 300 kilometers from the capital city of Delhi.
             Built from red and pink sandstone, the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, 
             or women's chambers. The structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai 
             Jai Singh, who was the founder of Jaipur. He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this 
             grand and historical palace. It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five floor exterior is akin to honeycomb with its 953 
             small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework. The original intent of the lattice design was to allow 
             royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen, since they had to obey 
             the strict rules of "purdah", which forbade them from appearing in public without face coverings. This architectural feature also 
             allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area
            more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.
