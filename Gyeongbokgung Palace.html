            Gyeongbokgung, also known as Gyeongbokgung Palace or Gyeongbok Palace, was the main royal 
            palace of the Joseon dynasty. Built in 1395, it is located in northern Seoul, South Korea. 
            The largest of the Five Grand Palaces built by the Joseon dynasty, Gyeongbokgung served as the 
            home of Kings of the Joseon dynasty, the Kings' households, as well as the government of Joseon. 
            Gyeongbokgung continued to serve as the main palace of the Joseon dynasty until the premises were 
            destroyed by fire during the Imjin War and abandoned for two centuries. However, in the 19th century, 
            all of the palace's 7,700 rooms were later restored under the leadership of Prince Regent Heungseon during 
            the reign of King Gojong. Some 500 buildings were restored on a site of over 40 hectares. The architectural
            principles of ancient Korea were incorporated into the tradition and appearance of the Joseon royal court. 
            In the early 20th century, much of the palace was systematically destroyed by Imperial Japan. Since the 1990s, 
            the walled palace complex is gradually being restored to its original form. 
            On January 21, 1963, it was designated as a cultural property.
