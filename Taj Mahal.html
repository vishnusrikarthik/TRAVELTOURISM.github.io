     <p>The Taj Mahal, originally the Rauza-i-munawwara is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern 
        bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah 
        Jahan to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. 
        The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in 
        formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed 
        in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to 
        have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 
        2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees. The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance 
        of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO
         World HeritageSite in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's 
         heritage".
