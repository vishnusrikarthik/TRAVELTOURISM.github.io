            Tarkwa Bay is an artificial sheltered beach located near the Lagos harbour in Nigeria. Due to its island status, it is only accessible by boat or water taxis. The beach, popular with swimmers and water-sports enthusiasts, also has a welcoming resident community. There are several parts of Lagos Island where you can board a ferry or high-speed boat to the bay. The most popular places to get a boat to Tarkwa Bay are Marina, Mekwe Jetty, and Tarzan Marine.
