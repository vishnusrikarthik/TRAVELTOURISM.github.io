            The Temple of Heaven is an imperial complex of religious buildings situated in the southeastern part of central Beijing. 
            The complex was visited by the Emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties for annual ceremonies of prayer to Heaven for a good 
            harvest. The Temple of Heaven was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998 and was described as "a masterpiece of 
            architecture and landscape design which simply and graphically illustrates a cosmogony of great importance for the evolution of 
            one of the world's great civilizations..." as the "symbolic layout and design of 
            the Temple of Heaven had a profound influence on architecture and planning in the Far East over many centuries."
