            Hwange National Park is the largest natural reserve in Zimbabwe. It is around 14,600 sq km in area, about the size of the USA state of Connecticut. It lies in the northwest of the country, just off the main road between Bulawayo and Victoria Falls. The nearest town is Dete. Histories of the region's pre-colonial days and its development as a game reserve and National Park are available online.
